## About

This Survival Games datapack raises the stakes of a traditional survival-based speedrunning competition by creating additional avenues for players to win. While the ultimate goal is still speedily reaching the End Dimension to [Free the End](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Advancement_guide/The_End_tab#Free_the_End), this datapack modifies the overall competition by assigning points for each vanilla advancement. This change makes slower players still have a competitive chance against speedier runners.

<summary>**Why?** </summary>
<br>

Minesgiving has hosted a Survival Games component since the very first Minesgiving event. The event has largely been successful, with the primary goal of players to be to race to the End Dimension as fast as possible and be the first one to defeat the Ender Dragon (more specifically, the player that obtains [Free The End](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Advancement_guide/The_End_tab#Free_the_End) first.)

This is a very predictable and objectionable event metric, as the specific advancement is only achieveable by *one person per Ender Dragon*. 

Going in to our 6th edition of Minesgiving, we wanted to address a consistent problem across each version of the game we've run the event:
-- 1.16 revamped the Nether biomes and increased the difficulty of Nether traversal, [impacting the process of locating a Nether Fortress/getting Blaze], but the speedrunning path remained the same.
-- 1.17/1.18/1.19 signficantly altered Overworld terrain generation, but didn't really change the speedrunning path, outside making the strongholds deeper and introducing The Deep Dark.
-- 1.20's only major impact on the speedrunning path was locking netherite completely behind Nether Bastions (not that netherite armor/tools are necessary to defeat the Ender Dragon)

With the introduction of Java Edition 1.21, we took the opportunity to experiment with the new advancements, and restructure Survival Games & the speedrunning process by utilizing the in-game advancement system with embedded points, while still maintaining the ultimate goal of [Freeing the End](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorials/Advancement_guide/The_End_tab#Free_the_End).
